Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors (bugs) in a computer program. When writing code, errors may occur that prevent the program from functioning properly. Debugging involves locating and resolving these issues.

Python is a simple, readable, and versatile programming language used to create applications in various fields such as web development, artificial intelligence, data analysis, and automation.

The debugging process includes:

-Analyzing errors: Understanding the error message and where it occurs in the code.
-Isolating the problem: Testing specific parts of the code to pinpoint the error.
-Fixing the issue: Modifying the code to resolve the problem.
-Retesting: Ensuring the error is fixed and the program works as expected.

Tools like the pdb debugger in Python, logging messages, and IDEs help streamline the debugging process.
