### Python: Overview

Python is an intuitive and easy-to-read programming language, widely used in fields such as web development, artificial intelligence, and data analysis. Its clear syntax, dynamic typing, and extensive library ecosystem make it a popular choice.

### Debugging in Python

Debugging involves identifying and fixing issues in the code. Python offers several tools to make this process easier:

- **Clear error messages** that help pinpoint problems.
- **Print debugging**: Using `print()` statements to track code execution.
- **`pdb` (Python Debugger)**: An integrated debugger that allows real-time interaction with the code.
- **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)** like PyCharm or VS Code, which offer visual debugging tools.
- **Unit testing**: Using frameworks like `unittest` or `pytest` to ensure the code behaves as expected.

Debugging is crucial for maintaining high-quality code, and Python makes this task more accessible and efficient.
